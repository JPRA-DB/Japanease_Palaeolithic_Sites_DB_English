※日本旧石器時代遺跡データベースをGithub上で公開する際のイメージを回覧するためのテストページです。

## Overview
This database was created by Japanese Palaeolithic Research Association and contains information on Paleolithic and the Incipient Jomon Period sites in the Japanese archipelago.
The first edition of the database was created in 2010 and contained 16,771 archaeological sites, and subsequent editions with revisions made on a prefecture-by-prefecture basis are released in this repositly.
We expect that this database will be of great use in elucidating Paleolithic culture, as it is one of the few large-scale databases of archaeological sites in the world.

## Usage
The database is divided into prefectures, each of which consists of the following,

1. Main body: Site names, Geographic informations, assemblage etc.
2. Reference
