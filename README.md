This database was created by Japanese Palaeolithic Research Association and contains information on Paleolithic and the Incipient Jomon Period sites in the Japanese archipelago.
The first edition of the database(ver.10.00) was created in 2010 and contained 16,771 archaeological sites, and subsequent editions (ver.2.00) with revisions made on a prefecture-by-prefecture basis are released in this repositly.Subsequent edition contains corrections and additional data not included in the 2010 edition. The ID is the same as that of the 2010 edition. Please use the ID (JPRA-ID) to link to the data.

We expect that this database will be of great use in elucidating Paleolithic culture, as it is one of the few large-scale databases of archaeological sites in the world.

Data is provided in Excel files (.xlsx) and comma-separated text files (.csv) for each prefecture.
The following changes have been made to the contents on ver.2.00.

(1) Changed location coordinates to decimal notation in the World Geodetic System (dd.dddddddd)

(2) Document IDs are added.

(3) Reference information of document data is linked.

Distribution maps are not newly created or published.
